# Character Creation

## Create Your Dealer

Players and GMs both control Dealers. A Dealer is someone who is in charge of their own
fate, and likely plays using their own unique deck. Players are able to level up their Dealers
by playing in Adventures, and GMs can set the level of their Dealers to best balance
Encounters during a session.

Every Dealer can take Powers and Vulnerabilities, and has Attribute and Skill Modifiers
that impact
their ability to interact with the world around them.

Outlined below are the steps to building a
Dealer as part of Character Creation. GMs can find additional advice on how to create a
GM Dealer in the [GM Guide](./02_GMGuide.md)

## Decide Your Background

First, choose where your character is coming from including your lived experiences that
would motivate adventuring. Classically, this is a 'racial' or species origin
(e.g., Dwarves, Humans, or Elves of Fantasy) that fits with the GM's setting.
This has no inherent mechanical impact, but may shape how your character
navigates challenges. Growing up at a seaport, your character might be more
adept at sailing (i.e., certain Skill Checks) than others. Coming to a new land as an
outsider might be a [Vulnerability](./03_CharacterCreation.md#choose-your-vulnerabilities),
as described below.

Characters beginning their journey at Level 1 are relatively unskilled. They may have
had one profession for many years, but should not have significant experience
adventuring or traveling beyond the borders of the comfort zone shared by their peers.
Work with your GM if you feel your character would have specific experience related to
their background.

## Choose Your Role

Your Role describes how your character navigates challenges. While a Defender might
apply force, a Caster might find a more magical solution. Choosing a Role grants you
access to specific Powers. Each Role has a skill they use to attack in
combat (e.g., Brute or Knowledge). You can switch your Role later on, but must
forfeit Powers with a prerequisite Role in exchange for the points previously spent.

- Caster
    - Description: Casters can be mages of fantasy or techno-wizards of a much more
    mundane world. Their intellect drives them to skills the rest of us can barely
    comprehend.
    - Primary Attribute: Intelligence
    - Suggested Primary Skill: Knowledge
    - Example Powers: Attack, Mystic Aura, Slow
- Defender
    - Description: Defenders can take a hit and keep protecting their allies. They focus
    more on battlefield control during combat than outright damage. Not someone to mess
    with!
    - Primary Attribute: Strength
    - Suggested Primary Skill: Brute
    - Example Powers: Shield, Self, Attack, Sweep
- Martial
    - Description: Martials move quick and hit hard. They're adept with physical weapons
    to directly damage enemies. Agile and light on their feet!
    - Primary Attribute: Agility
    - Suggested Primary Skill: Finesse
    - Example Powers: Attack, Charge, Attack, Dual Wield
- Support
    - Description: Attending to their allies, support characters may focus on healing or
    other boons to sway the battle in their favor. We're all stronger thanks to the
    support of our friends.
    - Primary Attribute: Intuition
    - Suggested Primary Skill: Craft
    - Example Powers: Lend Vigor, Attack, Mystic Entangle

## Using Experience Points (XP)

At character creation (6) and for each level up (3), you are
awarded Experience Points. These points can be spent to gain additional Powers, boost an
Attribute or a Skill, or remove a Vulnerability. Total XP is
equal to 6 + (Level * 3). You may have leftover XP after a level up, but your XP can
never be negative.

On level up, a GM may allow you to re-specialize (known as respec). This allows you to
exchange Powers for their
equivalent XP value, and reduce any Attributes or Skills down to 0. You may also choose
at this time to change your Role, though you can no longer access any Powers that require
your old Role.

### Choose Your Powers

Powers are your way of amplifying your character both on and off the battlefield,
covering simple abilities like swinging a weapon to complicated magical feats. Some
Powers require a specific Role, prerequisite levels or relevant Attribute/Skill
Modifiers. These are listed in each Power's description.

Each Power has an associated XP cost to add to your character. Passive mechanics, or
minor magical tricks typically cost 1 XP. Big, character-altering feats will cost more.

Major Powers are tiresome and require a limited resource to use: Power Points (PP). Each Power will list
the PP that must be spent to use the Power. Some Powers allow for different effects
depending on the PP expended (e.g., 1 PP to target one enemy vs. 2 PP to target
multiple). The more PP spent, the bigger the effect. Numbers separated by `or` in the
mechanics description indicate different effects depending on PP spent.

Starting at Level 1, each character will have a total of 3 PP. At levels 3, 5, and 7, your maximum amount of PP increases by 2. 
PP are replenished on a [Rest](./01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#rests).

Unless otherwise noted, Powers...

1. Take a Major Action to perform and use a Dealer's Primary
 Skill Modifier.

2. That have sustained effects, may only be used one at a time. Passive Powers take no
action and are always in effect.

3. That damage, deal 1 point of damage.

4. That have implied range, may be used up to 6 spaces away.

### Choose Your Vulnerabilities

People are not perfect, and many have Vulnerabilities as a result of their relationship
with the world. At character creation you can choose up to four Vulnerabilities, which
add mechanical and roleplay implications, like being afraid of fire or unable to swim.
Adding Vulnerabilities to your character will grant you additional Experience Points
during character creation. Each Vulnerability added grants 1 (Minor) or 2
(Major) Experience Points, but you can only gain 4 total Experience Points during
character creation. A GM may overrule this limit if, for example, the events of the
story result in a character gaining an additional Vulnerability.

When roleplaying your character, keep these Vulnerabilities in mind. How do they shape
the way your character interacts with the world, and how might this affect their
relationships with others?

Vulnerability types:

- **Minor**: Adds 1 XP
- **Major**: Adds 2 XP

Some Vulnerabilities can be either Minor or Major, depending on the effects you choose.
Work with your GM if a Vulnerability has story implications (e.g., Hunted or
Outsider).

### Modifying Attributes and Skills

All Attributes and Skills start at a 0 Modifier. You can adjust your Skills and
Attributes using your Experience Points (XP), which will help define how capable your
character is for relevant actions. On initial character creation, you can spend or earn
points by increasing or decreasing Attributes and Skill Modifiers up to -2 or +2 at
Level 1. This upper limit increases as you level up (see table below). Once modifiers
are set at character creation, a player may only add newly awarded Experience points.

**Mod Cap by Level**

| Level | SkillCap |
|:-----:|:--------:|
| 1     | 2        |
| 2     | 2        |
| 3     | 3        |
| 4     | 3        |
| 5     | 3        |
| 6     | 4        |
| 7     | 5        |
| 8     | 5        |
| 9     | 5        |
| 10    | 6        |

When modifying an Attribute, the related Skills are affected as well. This means that
boosting Strength to a +1 will also add a +1 to Brute and Intimidation. Reducing an
Attribute by -1 also reduces the related Skills by -1.

Raising an Attribute Modifier by +1 initially costs 2 Experience Points. Raising a Skill
Modifier by +1 initially costs 1 Experience Point. In both cases, raising
modifiers becomes more costly as you add. The table below shows the cost in
Experience Points and the resulting modifier for Attributes and Skills.

**XP Cost for Attributes (left) and Skills (Right)**

| XP Cost | Attrib<br />Mod| XP Cost | Skill<br />Mod |
|  :---:  |    :---:       |  :---:  |    :---:       |
|     -4  | -2             |     -2  | -2             |
|     -2  | -1             |     -1  | -1             |
|     0   | 0              |     0   | 0              |
|     2   | 1              |     1   | 1              |
|     4   | 2              |     2   | 2              |
|     8   | 3              |     4   | 3              |
|     12  | 4              |     6   | 4              |
|     18  | 5              |     9   | 5              |
|     24  | 6              |     12  | 6              |
